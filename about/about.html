<summary><strong> Arthas is a student project led by <a href="{{- page.li-za -}}">Alessandro Zanella</a> that aims to develop a fully automated single interface system for cell cultivation.</strong>
</summary><br>
<p>The protoype will be build with help of the Arduino & Raspberry Pi plattform. and will cover the vast majority of key features that a automated cell culture system should have.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Liquid & culture Handling</li>
    <li>Aseptic Techniques (Conform BLS Chart)</li>
    <li>Incubator (CO2, Oxygen, Humidity, Temperature, Light)</li>
    <li>Cell Freezer/Refridgerator</li>
</ul>

<summary><strong> What are automated cell culture system and why are they useful?</strong>
</summary><br>
<p>Automated cell culture systems are instruments that mechanically carry out the steps involved in growing and maintaining a cell culture. Useful in any lab that works with cell biology, cell signaling, protein expression, or drug discovery, an automated cell culture system helps to grow cell cultures while saving labor time and reducing errors. Automated cell culture systems can be capable of diluting samples, growing cultures in liquid with constant swirling, plating cultures, or placing cultures in wells. When choosing an automated cell culture system, consider the needs of your lab. There are systems that do large volumes of one cell line or can culture many cell lines at once. Some automated cell culture systems can control the temperature with heating, cooling, or both and some allow you to track the cells with on board microscopes and cameras.</p>
